# üìÅ Archived Documentation

This folder contains documentation files that were created during the initial setup process but are no longer needed in the root directory. These files are kept for historical reference.

## Files in this archive:

- **SETUP_SUMMARY.md** - Initial semantic versioning setup summary
- **FINAL_SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - Setup completion documentation
- **GITHUB_PERMISSIONS_FIX.md** - GitHub permissions troubleshooting guide
- **COMMIT_EXAMPLES.md** - Conventional commit examples (now integrated into CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Current Documentation Structure

The main documentation is now organized as follows:

### Root Directory (User-facing)
- **README.MD** - Main project documentation
- **QUICK_START.md** - Quick start guide for users and developers
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Comprehensive contributing guide
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Production deployment guide
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Auto-generated changelog

### docs/ Directory (Technical)
- **docs/rate-limiter-plan.md** - Rate limiting implementation plan
- **docs/archive/** - Historical documentation files

This structure provides better organization and reduces clutter in the root directory while maintaining all essential information for users and contributors.
